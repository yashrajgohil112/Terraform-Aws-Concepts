# Day 13: Terraform Data Sources with AWS

This lesson demonstrates how to use Terraform data sources to reference existing infrastructure in AWS. We will provision an EC2 instance into a pre-existing VPC and subnet.

## Scenario

We have a "shared" VPC and subnet that were created by another team or process. Our task is to launch a new EC2 instance into this existing network infrastructure without managing the VPC or subnet with our Terraform configuration.

### Pre-existing Infrastructure

The following resources are assumed to exist in your AWS account:

*   **VPC:** with the tag `Name` = `shared-network-vpc`
*   **Subnet:** with the tag `Name` = `shared-primary-subnet`

### Terraform Configuration (`main.tf`)

Our Terraform code will:

1.  **Define Data Sources:**
    *   `data "aws_vpc" "shared"`: This block tells Terraform to find a VPC with the tag `Name` set to `shared-network-vpc`.
    *   `data "aws_subnet" "shared"`: This block finds a subnet with the tag `Name` set to `shared-primary-subnet` within the VPC found by the previous data source.
    *   `data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux_2"`: This block finds the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI to use for our EC2 instance.

2.  **Use Data Source Outputs:**
    *   The `aws_instance` resource uses `data.aws_subnet.shared.id` to launch into the existing subnet.
    *   The `aws_instance` resource also uses `data.aws_ami.amazon_linux_2.id` for the AMI.

## How to Run This Demo

### 1. Create the Pre-existing Infrastructure

First, we need to simulate the creation of the shared network resources.

```bash
cd lessons/day13/code/setup
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This will create a VPC and a subnet.

### 2. Provision the EC2 Instance

Now, we'll run the main Terraform configuration that uses data sources.

```bash
cd ../.. # Go back to the day13/code directory
terraform init
terraform plan
```

**Expected Plan Output:** The plan should show that Terraform will create **1 new resource**: an `aws_instance`. It should **not** show any changes to the VPC or subnet.

```bash
terraform apply
```
### 3. Verification

1.  Go to the AWS EC2 console.
2.  Find the instance named `day13-instance`.
3.  Check its "Networking" details. You will see that it is in the `shared-network-vpc` and `shared-primary-subnet`, confirming that the data sources worked correctly.

### 4. Cleanup

To destroy the resources created in this lesson:

```bash
# Destroy the instance
cd lessons/day13/code
terraform destroy

# Destroy the shared VPC and subnet
cd setup
terraform destroy
```
